# Interpreting Statistics and Entropy

## Why Using XKPasswd is Better Than Making Up Your Own Passwords

Humans are incapable of creating truly random passwords. We naturally gravitate towards words and numbers that have meaning in our lives, such as birthdays or pets names. Using XKPasswd brings us much closer to truly randomly generated passwords.

But randomly generated passwords can still be easy to crack, so it‚Äôs necessary to do some maths to ensure that the passwords generated by XKPasswd are strong enough to withstand attacks.  In the section of this guide entitled [‚Äúüêâ Thar be Dragons!‚Äù](the-maths.md) Bart Busschots explains the maths behind XKPasswd.  

This section of the user guide is intended to help you understand what the statistics presented mean to you, even without understanding the maths behind how they‚Äôre calculated.

## High Entropy is Good, Low is Bad

Without understanding what entropy is or how it‚Äôs calculated, you only need to know that a high number for entropy means the password is stronger and is harder to crack.  But we don‚Äôt even have to interpret the numbers ourselves, because XKPasswd will indicate in green, yellow, and red how hard it would be to crack a password with the settings that you‚Äôve chosen.

Simply put, green good, yellow OK, red bad!

## Examples

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at some examples to explain the color coding (and the numbers.). If we start with the default settings and simply click the Generate button to get 3 passwords, we can see the Strength says Good in a green box, and all of the Entropy numbers are highlighted in green as well.

The Strength is marked green with Good in the box because all of the entropy numbers are good.¬†

example of poor - Temporary
all are red


example of still poor
 temporary but min length 4, max length 5
 poor because full knowledge and configuration of some blind are < 78 bits of entropy
 
 Example of OK
 temporary but 3 words of 4/4
 blind is 92 but full knowledge is 33
 
 DELETEME:
 ```js	
 	__passwordStrength(stats) {
    const minEntropyBlind = stats.minEntropyBlind.value;
    const entropySeen = stats.entropySeen.value;

    const entropyBlindThreshold = this.#entropyBlindThreshold;
    const entropySeenThreshold = this.#entropySeenThreshold;

    // mix of good and bad
    let passwordStrength = 'OK';

    if ((minEntropyBlind >= entropyBlindThreshold) &&
        (entropySeen >= entropySeenThreshold)) {
      // all good
      passwordStrength = 'GOOD';
    } else if ((minEntropyBlind < entropyBlindThreshold) &&
               (entropySeen < entropySeenThreshold)) {
      // all bad
      passwordStrength = 'POOR';
    }
    return passwordStrength;
  }
